Welcome to the README of **Data Analysis Project: Capital Bikeshare System**. 

## The Dataset üìà
This repository uses the **Capital Bikeshare** dataset, available [here](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). Weather information are extracted from [here](http://www.freemeteo.com). The data for this repository is present within the DATASET folder downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaBmV6Q6FYWU4HWZs80Suqd7KQC34diQ/view?usp=sharing).

## The Devs ‚úíÔ∏è
This repository is developed as Final Assignment of **Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python** module, a part of **Data Science** class of **IDCamp2023** organized by **Dicoding**. 

## The Problems üìù
This repository is focusing on these following bulletpoints:
* Trend of bike rides over given years
* Peaks during time - monthly, weekly, hourly (most requested hour of the days)
* Casual riders vs Registered members, customer behaviour on usage of bikeshare
* Contribution of weather condition on bike demands
* Season wise hourly distribution of bike rentals

## The Directory üìÇ
* `/assets` : contains pictures which are used in this project
* `/dashboard`: contains the file bikeshare_dashboard.py which stores the functions needed by the dashboard
* `/dataset`: stores dataset used in this project
* `README.md`: file that provides information about this GitHub project
* `notebook.ipynb`: interactive jupyter notebook files to analyze data
* `requirements.txt`: file that stores information about the libraries used in this project
* `license.txt` : file that maintain license of copy right of the dataset owners

## The Libraries üìö
* `numpy` library to carry out numerical computation such as sets, arrays, multidimension matrixes, and vectors
* `pandas` library to undergo data processing, analysing, and manipulation.
* `seaborn` library to develop statistical data visualization based on `matplotlib`
* `matplotlib` library to perform visualization using plotting
* `plotly.express` library to perform interactive plotting
* `streamlit` library to develop interactive dashboard
